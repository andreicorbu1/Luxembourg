# Luxembourg
Luxembourg map traversal Dijkstra's algorithms

# Functionality
The program reads an XML file consisting of a pool of nodes and edges. \
Then the program draws it on the screen. You have to left click to get the starting node(it will choose the closest node to where you click on the screen) and right click to get the end node.\
Then the program will draw the shortest path between the 2 points and the total cost that it takes to get there.
